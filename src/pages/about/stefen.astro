const description = `Stefen is our other co-founder and resident code expert — the one who learned to write software back when you
couldn’t just ask an AI nicely and get an answer. He comes from the era of reading questionable documentation,
trial-and-error debugging, and solving problems the hard way. He obsesses over clean architecture, accessible
UIs, performance, and building things that won’t mysteriously implode later due to too many dependencies. He
will also, without warning, pivot a conversation to talk about CyberTrucks, humanoid robots, or new battery
technology — which is how you know you’re talking to a true, deeply committed nerd.`;
