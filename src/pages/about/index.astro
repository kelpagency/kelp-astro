        <h2>Founding Story</h2>
        <p>Kelp didn’t start as an agency—it started as people who enjoyed working together and cared deeply about how the work was done.</p>
        <p>Stefen and Luke began collaborating as freelancers in the early 2010s before moving into the agency world. After eventually working at the same agency alongside Caleb Kenney, they shared a growing frustration with trend-driven work that prioritized marketing gimmicks over strong design, solid engineering, and common-sense strategies.</p>
        <p>In 2018, they founded Kelp to build something better: an agency led by thoughtful design, well-built products, and a healthy, honest culture.</p>
        <p>Today, Kelp is a small, senior team doing focused work we’re proud of—trusted by clients who value clarity, longevity, and craftsmanship.</p>
