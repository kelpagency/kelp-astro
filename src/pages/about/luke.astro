const description = `Luke is our co-founder and creative master—the person who can turn a loose idea into something polished,
intentional, and built to last. He’s designed everything from logos and brand systems to beer cans and
oatmeal packaging, and at this point can pretty much design anything put in front of him. He has a sharp eye
for detail, a deep understanding of how design actually gets used, and a habit of thinking several steps
ahead. When he’s not refining a project, he’s probably trying to convince the rest of the team to sign up for
another 21.1k.`;
