const description = `Andrew Prouty runs projects day to day and is the primary point of contact for our clients&thinsp;—&thinsp;which means he’s
the one keeping timelines tight, communication clear, and expectations grounded in reality. He has a rare mix
of organization, technical understanding, and calm honesty, even when the honest answer isn’t the easiest one
to hear. Andrew is great at translating complexity into clarity, keeping everyone aligned, and making sure
nothing quietly drifts off course. He also drinks chai lattes instead of coffee, which we’ve accepted, though
not without questions.`;
