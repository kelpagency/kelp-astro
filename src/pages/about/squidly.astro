const description = `Squid Squidly is the Kelp mascot, popping up wherever we need a bit more energy, curiosity, and good vibes.
He keeps the team light on its fins, cheers on big launches, and reminds us that good work can still be fun. We like to think of him as the representation of our collective AI brain. Resistence is futile.`;
