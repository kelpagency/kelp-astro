						We love building custom WordPress themes and plugins with a clear purpose. WordPress can be an incredibly powerful platform — as long as you respect its ecosystem and use it the way it was designed. We’ve embraced the Gutenberg editor and gone all-in on block-based themes. 
						<a href="https://woocommerce.com/posts/the-wooexpert-awards-americas-2023/">Automattic recognized our work</a> with <strong>The Innovator Award in 2023</strong>.

					<h2>HubSpot</h2>
					<p>
						HubSpot CMS gives marketers a powerful platform to grow with — but it can also be overwhelming if modules aren’t built with usability and flexibility in mind. We’ve solved that problem with award-winning themes focused on simplicity, scalability, and real-world marketing workflows. 
						In fact, we have <a href="https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/website?eco_providers=Kelp%20Creative%20Agency">two themes in the HubSpot Marketplace</a>, both of which <strong>won HubSpot awards</strong> in

					<h2>Shopify</h2>
					<p>
						Shopify stores can be built in two powerful ways: using traditional Liquid themes or with Hydrogen for a fully headless experience — and we’re experts at both. 
						Whether you’re launching a high-performing storefront with advanced functionality or building a scalable headless experience that connects across multiple sales channels, we create Shopify sites that are <strong>designed to sell and built to grow</strong>.
