        <p class="team-member-text-position">Project Manager</p>
        <p>
          Andrew Prouty runs projects day to day and is the primary point of contact for our clients—which means he’s
          the one keeping timelines tight, communication clear, and expectations grounded in reality. He has a rare mix
          of organization, technical understanding, and calm honesty, even when the honest answer isn’t the easiest one
          to hear. Andrew is great at translating complexity into clarity, keeping everyone aligned, and making sure
          nothing quietly drifts off course. He also drinks chai lattes instead of coffee, which we’ve accepted, though
          not without questions.

        <h3>Brandon Berlew</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Creative Producer</p>
        <p>
          Brandon is our creative producer and motion wizard—the person responsible for making things move, feel alive,
          and look effortlessly polished. He’s a master of video, After Effects, motion graphics, visual storytelling,
          and also happens to be a very capable web developer when projects need that extra layer of technical finesse.
          Brandon has a sharp sense of timing, a strong visual instinct, and an eye for the details most people miss.
          Outside of work, he’s usually wrangling multiple pets or playing ultimate frisbee, which explains both his
          patience and his ability to move very fast when needed.

        <p>
          Jude is our marketing specialist, and one of the few people in the world that understands how Google Tag
          Manager works. With a skill set that stretches well beyond strategy and analytics. He’s equally at home behind
          a camera, shooting photography and video, or behind an espresso machine pulling a genuinely great shot. Jude
          brings a sharp creative eye to marketing work and understands how content actually performs in the real world.
          As the youngest on the team, he’s naturally taken on the role of the little brother—occasionally roasted,
          always supported, and fully trusted to deliver when it matters.

        <p>
          Luke is our co-founder and creative master—the person who can turn a loose idea into something polished,
          intentional, and built to last. He’s designed everything from logos and brand systems to beer cans and protein
          oatmeal packaging, and at this point can pretty much design anything put in front of him. He has a sharp eye
          for detail, a deep understanding of how design actually gets used, and a habit of thinking several steps
          ahead. When he’s not refining a project, he’s probably trying to convince the rest of the team to sign up for
          another 10k.

        <h3>Stefen Phelps</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Developer / Co-founder</p>
        <p>
          Stefen is our other co-founder and resident code expert — the one who learned to write software back when you
          couldn’t just ask an AI nicely and get an answer. He comes from the era of reading questionable documentation,
          trial-and-error debugging, and solving problems the hard way. He obsesses over clean architecture, accessible
          UIs, performance, and building things that won’t mysteriously implode later due to too many dependencies. He
          will also, without warning, pivot a conversation to talk about CyberTrucks, humanoid robots, or new battery
          technology — which is how you know you’re talking to a true, deeply committed nerd.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Kelp didn’t start as an agency. It started as two freelancers helping each other out.</p>
      <p>
        Stefen and Luke met in the late 2000s, trading design and development work back and forth while building their
        skills and learning the craft the hard way—by doing it. There was no grand plan, just mutual respect and a
        shared care for good work.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the early 2010s, both dove deep into the professional design and development world. Stefen joined a
        HubSpot-focused marketing agency in Tampa in 2014. Luke began working at a marketing agency in Brooksville soon
        after. A few years later, they found themselves at the same agency—this time with experience, perspective, and a
        growing sense that something was off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, decisions were driven by trends instead of substance. Marketing led the conversation, while design
        and engineering were expected to catch up. The work moved fast—but not always forward.
      </p>
      <p>So we decided to build the kind of place we wished existed.</p>
      <p>
        Kelp became real in 2018. The idea was simple: let strong thinking, good design, and well-built products lead.
        Marketing still matters—but only when it’s built on something solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, we’ve grown into a small, focused team of five. Our work has been recognized by WordPress and
        HubSpot, but what matters more is the trust we’ve built with clients who care about doing things right.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re still collaborating the way we always have—thoughtfully, honestly, and with a deep respect for the craft.
