      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Kelp didn’t start as an agency. It started as two freelancers helping each other out.</p>
      <p>
        Stefen and Luke met in the late 2000s, trading design and development work back and forth while building their
        skills and learning the craft the hard way—by doing it. There was no grand plan, just mutual respect and a
        shared care for good work.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the early 2010s, both dove deep into the professional design and development world. Stefen joined a
        HubSpot-focused marketing agency in Tampa in 2014. Luke began working at a marketing agency in Brooksville soon
        after. A few years later, they found themselves at the same agency—this time with experience, perspective, and a
        growing sense that something was off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, decisions were driven by trends instead of substance. Marketing led the conversation, while design
        and engineering were expected to catch up. The work moved fast—but not always forward.
      </p>
      <p>So we decided to build the kind of place we wished existed.</p>
      <p>
        Kelp became real in 2018. The idea was simple: let strong thinking, good design, and well-built products lead.
        Marketing still matters—but only when it’s built on something solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, we’ve grown into a small, focused team of five. Our work has been recognized by WordPress and
        HubSpot, but what matters more is the trust we’ve built with clients who care about doing things right.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re still collaborating the way we always have—thoughtfully, honestly, and with a deep respect for the craft.
