        <h3>Andrew Prouty</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Project Manager</p>
        <p>
          Andrew Prouty runs projects day to day and is the primary point of contact for our clients—which means he’s
          the one keeping timelines tight, communication clear, and expectations grounded in reality. He has a rare mix
          of organization, technical understanding, and calm honesty, even when the honest answer isn’t the easiest one
          to hear. Andrew is great at translating complexity into clarity, keeping everyone aligned, and making sure
          nothing quietly drifts off course. He also drinks chai lattes instead of coffee, which we’ve accepted, though
          not without questions.

        <h3>Brandon Berlew</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Creative Producer</p>
        <p>
          Brandon is our creative producer and motion wizard—the person responsible for making things move, feel alive,
          and look effortlessly polished. He’s a master of video, After Effects, motion graphics, and animation, and
          also happens to be a very capable web developer when projects need that extra layer of technical finesse.
          Brandon has a sharp sense of timing, a strong visual instinct, and an eye for the details most people miss.
          Outside of work, he’s usually wrangling multiple pets or playing ultimate frisbee, which explains both his
          patience and his ability to move very fast when needed.

        <h3>Jude House</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Marketing Specialist</p>
        <p>
          Jude is our marketing specialist, with a skill set that stretches well beyond strategy and analytics. He’s
          equally at home behind a camera, shooting photography and video, or behind an espresso machine pulling a
          genuinely great shot. Jude brings a sharp creative eye to marketing work and understands how content actually
          performs in the real world. As the youngest on the team, he’s naturally taken on the role of the little
          brother—occasionally roasted, always supported, and fully trusted to deliver when it matters.

        <h3>Luke Kenney</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Creative Director / Co-founder</p>
        <p>
          Luke is our co-founder and creative master—the person who can turn a loose idea into something polished,
          intentional, and built to last. He’s designed everything from logos and brand systems to beer cans and protein
          oatmeal packaging, and at this point can pretty much design anything put in front of him. He has a sharp eye
          for detail, a deep understanding of how design actually gets used, and a habit of thinking several steps
          ahead. When he’s not refining a project, he’s probably trying to convince the rest of the team to sign up for
          another 10k.

        <h3>Stefen Phelps</h3>
        <p class="team-member-text-position">Developer / Co-founder</p>
        <p>
          Stefen is our other co-founder and resident code expert — the one who learned to write software back when you
          couldn’t just ask an AI nicely and get an answer. He comes from the era of reading questionable documentation,
          trial-and-error debugging, and solving problems the hard way. He obsesses over clean architecture, accessible
          UIs, performance, and building things that won’t mysteriously implode later due to too many dependencies. He
          will also, without warning, pivot a conversation to talk about CyberTrucks, humanoid robots, or new battery
          technology — which is how you know you’re talking to a true, deeply committed nerd.
