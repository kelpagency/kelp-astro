		<h2>Our<br> Kelp<br> Culture</h2>

		<p>
			We’re a small, senior team that takes the work seriously—and ourselves just seriously enough.
		</p>

		<p>
			Andrew runs projects day to day and serves as the primary point of contact for clients. That clarity matters to us. It keeps communication clean, decisions fast, and projects moving without unnecessary noise.
		</p>

		<p>
			Behind the scenes, we obsess over technical details. Not because it’s flashy, but because good work is usually invisible when it’s done right. Performance, structure, maintainability, and long-term sanity matter more to us than shortcuts that look good in a deck but fail in the real world.

		<h3>Work That Respects Real Life</h3>

		<p>
			We all have families. Kids. Spouses. People who depend on us.
		</p>

		<p>
			So we don’t work more than 40 hours a week—and we don’t pretend that “hustle” is a virtue. Instead, we make every hour count. Focused work. Fewer meetings. Clear priorities. No performative busyness.
		</p>

		<p>
			That constraint has made us better. It forces discipline, intention, and respect for everyone’s time—ours and yours.

	<div class="culture-text">
		<h3>Honest, Even When It’s Uncomfortable</h3>

		<p>
			We’re honest to a fault.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sometimes that honesty makes us look less confident than agencies that always say “yes.” Clients often prefer certainty over humility—but we’ll still tell you when something isn’t the right approach, when there’s risk, or when a better option exists.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’d rather be transparent than impressive. Trust lasts longer that way.

		<h3>Specialists Who Actually Help Each Other</h3>

		<p>
			Each person on our team has deep expertise in a specific niche. At the same time, no one works in a silo.
		</p>

		<p>
			We help where help is needed. We review each other’s work. We care about the final outcome more than ownership or ego. That balance lets us move quickly without sacrificing quality.

		<h3>Tools Are Tools (Not a Religion)</h3>

		<p>
			We don’t chase trends—but we’re not allergic to change either.
		</p>

		<p>
			AI, plugins, frameworks, and shiny new tools all have a place. The trick is knowing when to reach for them and when not to. We avoid building dependency on any single tool to the point where the work couldn’t exist without it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Good tools should make the work easier, not replace understanding.

		<h3>Built on the Open Web</h3>

		<p>
			We believe in open standards.
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of chasing the latest SEO hack, we focus on building things the right way: semantic structure, accessibility, performance, and a genuinely good user experience. We believe great products come first—marketing comes second, not the other way around.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you build something solid, discoverability tends to follow.

		<h3>Coffee Helps Us (Except for Andrew)</h3>

		<p>
			We drink a lot of coffee. A lot.
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess you can say we’re coffee people. Except Andrew, who drinks chai lattes because he doesn’t like coffee, which we tolerate but will never fully understand.
		</p>

		<p>
			We also say internet meme words like “glizzy” or “67” purely to annoy each other. This has no measurable impact on project outcomes, but morale remains high.

		<h3>Mostly In-Office, Sometimes Remote</h3>

		<p>
			We prefer working together in person when possible. Our new office will be finished later this year, and we’re excited to be back in the same space.
		</p>

		<p>
			That said, we’ve been fully remote recently, and the work hasn’t suffered. We care more about how the work gets done than where our desk is.

		<h3>Why This Matters to Clients</h3>

		<p>
			All of this shapes how we work with you.
		</p>

		<p>
			You’ll get clear communication, honest guidance, focused effort, and work that’s built to last. No burnout cycles. No trend-chasing. No mystery process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just a thoughtful team doing careful work—one good hour at a time.
