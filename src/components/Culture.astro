    <h2>Our<br /> Kelp<br /> Culture</h2>

    <p>We’re a small, senior team that takes the work seriously&thinsp;—&thinsp;and ourselves just seriously enough.</p>

    <p>
      Andrew runs projects day to day and serves as the primary point of contact for clients. That clarity matters to
      us. It keeps communication clean, decisions fast, and projects moving without unnecessary noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behind the scenes, we obsess over technical details. Not because it’s flashy, but because good work is usually
      invisible when it’s done right. Performance, accessibility, open standards, maintainability, and long-term sanity
      matter more to us than shortcuts that look good in a deck but fail in the real world.
    </p>

    <h3>Work That Respects Real Life</h3>

    <p>We all have families. Kids. Spouses. People who depend on us.</p>

    <p>
      So we don’t typically work more than 40 hours a week&thinsp;—&thinsp;and we don’t pretend that “hustle” is a
      virtue. Instead, we make every hour count. Focused work. Fewer meetings. Clear priorities. No performative
      busyness.
    </p>

    <p>
      That constraint has made us better. It forces discipline, intention, and respect for everyone’s
      time&thinsp;—&thinsp;ours and yours.

  <div class="culture-text">
    <h3>Honest, Even When It’s Uncomfortable</h3>

    <p>We’re honest to a fault.</p>

    <p>
      Sometimes that honesty makes us look less confident than agencies that always say “yes.” Clients often prefer
      certainty over humility&thinsp;—&thinsp;but we’ll still tell you when something isn’t the right approach, when
      there’s risk, if a better option exists, or even if we are not 100% sure.
    </p>

    <p>We’d rather be transparent than impressive. Trust lasts longer that way.</p>

    <h3>Specialists Who Actually Help Each Other</h3>

    <p>Each person on our team has deep expertise in a specific niche. At the same time, no one works in a silo.</p>

    <p>
      We help where help is needed. We review each other’s work. We care about the final outcome more than ownership or
      ego. That balance lets us move quickly without sacrificing quality.

    <h3>Tools Are Tools (Not a Religion)</h3>

    <p>We don’t chase trends&thinsp;—&thinsp;but we’re not allergic to change either.</p>

    <p>
      AI, plugins, frameworks, and shiny new tools all have a place. The trick is knowing when to reach for them and
      when not to. We avoid building dependency on any single tool to the point where the work couldn’t exist without
      it.
    </p>

    <p>Good tools should make the work easier, not replace understanding.</p>

    <h3>Built on the Open Web</h3>

    <p>We believe in open standards.</p>

    <p>
      Instead of chasing the latest SEO hack or trendy development framework, we focus on building things the right way:
      semantic, accessible, performant, intuitive, and based on open standards. These things together create genuinely
      good user experiences and products that outperform and outlast everything else. We believe great products come
      first&thinsp;—&thinsp;marketing comes second, not the other way around.
    </p>

    <p>When you build something solid, discoverability tends to follow.</p>

    <h3>Coffee & Memes = 🫶</h3>

    <p>We drink a lot of coffee. A lot.</p>

    <p>
      I guess you can say we’re coffee people. Except Andrew, who drinks chai lattes because he doesn’t like coffee,
      which we tolerate but will never fully understand. Oh sorry, did we mention that already? Yeah... Andrew is weird.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also say internet meme words like “glizzy” or “leroy jenkins!” purely to annoy each other. This has no
      measurable impact on project outcomes, but morale remains high.

    <h3>Mostly In-Office, Sometimes Remote</h3>

    <p>
      We prefer working together in person when possible. Our new office will be finished later this year (🤞) near
      downtown Brooksville, and we’re excited to be back in the same space.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, we’ve been fully remote as of recently, and the work hasn’t suffered. We care more about how the work
      gets done than where our desk is.

      You’ll get clear communication, honest guidance, focused effort, and work that’s built to last. No burnout cycles.
      No trend-chasing. No mystery process.
